# Mathimatical-Dungeon
A turn-based mathimatical game created for a university team software project.

***Project Summary*** 

Our team's goal is to create an educational application for young children, around the age of 8-14. To go about this, we have chosen to create a card-based game with a simple battle mechanic. 

***How the game function*** 

The game will start with a map of nodes that the user can progress thought from left to right. When the user travels to a node, they will be taken to a “battle” of which they have to fight an enemy and get the health point to 0. To do this, they are given a hand of cards, with each card providing a different effect, for example taking 1 away from the enemy’s heath. However, the user will only have a small number of resources they can uses each turn with each card taking a different number of resources, and so the user will have to plan each turn out to make it effective. Once the user’s turn has been ended, it will become the enemy’s turn of which, they can now harm the player.  

This cycle continues of player’s turn then enemy’s turn continues, until the enemy’s or player’s health points have reached 0. if the player’s health reaches 0 it is game over, else the game continues, and the player is taken back to the map to progress from the node they were at. 

However, to make the game more educational, each time the player’s turn is about to begin they will be given a set mathematical question to answer. And depending on how many questions they answer relates to how may resources they get that turn, with 0 correct answers meaning their turn is skipped.

***How the game will be created***

The game will be created with the programming language python, with the GUI being created with python's in-built library Tkinter. When the game is being made the application will be broken up into sections, of which we will individually work on and then later can brought together, such as the visual assets, main menu etc. 

For the visual, we have chosen to make it pixel art. This is because, it reduces the detail needed to create the art and therefore keeps it simple to create. As well as this, there are many free tools that help us to create the assets needed.
